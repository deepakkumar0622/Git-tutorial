***Steps for adding Our local folder files into a new repository in git***

Step 1 -- Asusual create our folder in your local system 

Step 2 -- Open in vs code and add our files in the folders

Step 3 -- Now first change the local folder into git folder by using command
*git init --It initialize the folder into git folder

Step 3 -- Then same steps use the add command and the files and commit it 

Step 4 -- Changes occurs from this step we cant use the same origin command here because we don't declare any origin link here so first we need to declare our origin
          for that we need to create a new repository in the github.

Step 5 --  Now after creating copy the link of the repository then use the command 
*git remote add origin "Link of the repository" -- Now our origin is created

Step 6 -- Now use command 
*git branch --This command displays the branches in your repository
---Note : In default the git will create the branch name as "master"--

Step 7 -- If you need to change the branch name to main then use command 
*git branch -M main --This command change the branch name from master to main

Step 8 -- Now you can use the usual commands and work on it....!!
