***Steps for adding Our local folder files into a new repository in git***

Step 1 -- Asusual create our folder in your local system 

Step 2 -- Open in vs code and add our files in the folders

Step 3 -- Now first change the local folder into git folder by using command
*git init --It initialize the folder into git folder

Step 3 -- Then same steps use the add command and the files and commit it 

Step 4 -- Changes occurs from this step we cant use the same origin command here because we don't declare any origin link here so first we need to declare our origin
          for that we need to create a new repository in the github.

Step 5 --  Now after creating copy the link of the repository then use the command 
*git remote add origin "Link of the repository" -- Now our origin is created

Step 6 -- Now use command 
*git branch --This command displays the branches in your repository
---Note : In default the git will create the branch name as "master"--

Step 7 -- If you need to change the branch name to main then use command 
*git branch -M main --This command change the branch name from master to main

Step 8 -- Now you can use the usual commands and work on it....!!

***Steps for adding a new branch***
Step 1 -- create a new branch in the github,after creating the files in the main branch will be copied in the newly created branch 

Step 2 -- Now we can use the newly created branch in the vs code using command 
*git checkout branch name -- Open the new branch in the vs code 

Step 3 -- Then we can make anything in this branch!!!

--- Note : The changes in new branch will not reflected in the Main branch ---

***Steps for merging the new branch to main branch***

Step 1 -- Now we can merge the new branch with the main branch using command 
*git merge new branch name

--- Note : This command must be executed in the main branch---
<<---Some other branch commands are in the command.txt file---->>
